# jupyter
## This is my Junyper Notebook Repo
### Here is the instruction how I have installed on my macOS
Date: Jan.14, 2024
We will be installing the JupyterLab on the macOS.
Python : Python 3.10 ( installed using the Mac Ports)
The Mac Ports installed the “py310-pip” for the Python 3.10 and its path “/opt/local/bin/pip3”
=> /opt/local/bin/pip3 install jupyterlab

The above command will install the module under:
/Users/khasanov/Library/Python/3.10/lib/python/site-packages

To run the JupyterLab:
=> jupyter lab
By default it runs on the Port : 8888
http://localhost:8888/lab
